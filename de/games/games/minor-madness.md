# A Minor Madness

My Ludum Dare 38 jam submission
=================

##Abstract
I've been trapped...
For many millenia I've been sitting here, doing nothing...
And I'm bored. Gosh, I'm so bored.

But there may be hope.
A tiny spark of hope, that I may find entertainment.
Only with you, my fellow player, can I be entertained.
Entertain me!


##Description
You're trapped in magic lamp. Not a desk lamp, or a standing lamp. A magic lamp,
just like in that movie, Alladin. One day, while you're counting seconds, an
entity appears. He wants to enslave you. Inside a prison, that is. So it's
pointless for him. Anyways, you have to find him by killing everything on
your path.
