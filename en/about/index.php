        I'm Szymon, also known as pi_pi3 on Twitter, Steam, itch.io, etc.<br>
        I do game stuff, I do programming stuff, I do system stuff.<br>
        I've made some <a href="/en/games">games</a> in the past,<br>
        I've made some <a href="/en/other">other</a> programs and libraries in
        the past,<br>
        I've made contributions to open source projects, mainly the Redox
        <a href="https://github.com/redox-os/kernel">kernel</a> and
        <a href="https://github.com/redox-os/redox">OS</a>.

        Now I've made this project: a full-featured server with HTTP/-S,
        IMAP/-S, SMTP and of course SSH. I also have the possibility to host
        some game servers, like Minecraft, Team Fortress 2 or Unturned.
        All in my bedroom, for <s>free</s> $15/year + electricity costs +
        internet costs, all without professional help.

        I'm a pupil. A high school pupil. In fact, I'm doing my finals
        right now! I just finished my last exam. I want to study
        <abbr title="Computer Sciences">CS</abbr> after high school, ideally
        at the <a href="https://www.tum.de/en/homepage/">Munich Technical
        University</a>. Besides my application I'm also making this website
        available to the public, which, in my hope, will serve as a motivation
        for whoever handles the applications and a proof that I'm capable
        <a href="/en/games/">of</a>, <a href="/en/other/">well</a>,

    <p>
        I was born in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland. I lived in Poland for ten years of my
        life, after that I moved to Berlin with my mom. I've been attending a
        bilingual school for the past 8 years. This has helped me perfecting
        both my Polish and my German language. Since I spend majority of my
        spare time with my many computers and people over seas, I also developed
        formidable English skills. I like to call myself a trilingualist,
        although I'm not sure whether that's strictly true.

        About my love for electronics...<br>
        Ever since I remembered I had an indisputable love for electronics. It
        didn't matter to me whether or not I understood how it worked. When I
        was four, my brother got a computer for Christmas. Since then I was
        hooked. In 5th grade I wrote my first ever program. It was written in
        Pascal. Some time later I started learning about C++. But then I
        ditched programming for a long while. In 9th grade I bought Game Maker:
        Studio on discount on Steam.  Yeah, it was payed at the time. 4 months
        later I participated in Ludum Dare for the first time. Since then I've
        been going ever deeper into computers and low-level stuff. Today I'm
        working on gamedev, systems programming, I even invented
        <a href="/en/ylw">my own language</a>.
