    I'm Szymon, also known as pi_pi3 on Twitter, Steam, itch.io, etc.<br>
    I do game stuff, I do programming stuff, I do system stuff.<br>
    I've made some <a href="/en/games">games</a> in the past,<br>
    I've made some <a href="/en/other">other</a> programs and libraries in the
    past,<br>
    I've made contributions to open source projects, mainly the Redox

    <a href="https://github.com/redox-os/redox">OS</a>.

    Now I've made this project: a full-featured server with HTTP/-S, IMAP, POP3,
    SMTP and of course SSH. I also have the possibility to host some game
    servers, like Minecraft, Team Fortress 2 and Unturned. All in my bedroom,
    for <s>free</s>

    I'm a pupil. A (german) high school pupil. In fact, I'm doing my finals
    right now! I have a maths exam on Tuesday, 2nd May. Now, I want to study
    <abbr title="Computer Sciences">CS</abbr> after high school. Ideally at the
    <a href="https://www.tum.de/en/homepage/">Munich Technical University</a>.
    Besides my application I'm also making this website public, which, in my
    hope, will serve as a motivation for whoever handles the applications and
    a proof that I'm capable <a href="/en/games/">of</a>,

    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <p>
    I was born in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland. I lived in Poland for ten years of my life,
    after that I moved to Berlin with my mom. I've been attending a bilingual
    school for the past 8 years. This has helped me perfecting both my Polish
    and my German language. Since I spend majority of my spare time with my
    many computers and people over seas, I also developed formidable English
    skills. I like to call myself a trilingualist, although I'm not sure whether
    that's strictly true.

    About my love for electronics...<br>
    Ever since I remembered I had an indisputable love for electronics. It
    didn't matter to me whether or not I understood how it worked. When I was
    four, my brother got a computer for Christmas. Since then I was hooked. In
    5th grade I wrote my first ever program. It was written in Pascal. Some time
    later I started learning about C++. But then I ditched programming for a
    long while. In 9th grade I bought Game Maker: Studio on discount on Steam.
    Yeah, it was payed at the time. 4 months later I participated in Ludum Dare
    for the first time. Since then I've been going ever deeper into computers
    and low-level stuff. Today I'm working on gamedev, systems programming, I
    even invented <a href="https://github.com/pi-pi3/ylw">my own language</a>.
