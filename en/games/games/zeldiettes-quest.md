An proof-of-concept tactical RPG 
=================

## Description

Zeldiette's Quest is a tactical RPG. It's main mechanic is stopping time and
planning your actions before restarting time. But why am I talking? It's a
game, so download it and play it. But first maybe read this guide and the
controls.

## Guide

You can stop time by pressing space bar. Then you can make actions which will
be executed after you restart time by pressing space bar again. Your goal is to
find Master Shi Mun and with his help find the princess. Do spend some time
exploring, as you will find useful stuff for the final encounter. All enemies
presented in this prologue are passive. They will roam mindlessly, but if you
attack one, it will attack you. Be quick when fighting them. You start with
your fists and a fireball spell (Because why the heck not? Fireballs are
awesome.) 

Attention: This game is not turn-based. All environmental actions will be
executed whenever time is not paused. 

And I kinda forgot to make sounds and music, so you'll have to listen to AC/DC
or Iron Maiden while playing it.

When you're in the inventory menu, you can move items by clicking on them and
clicking on the spot you want to move it to.

## Controls
