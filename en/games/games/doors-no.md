# Doors? NO!

My Ludum Dare 37 compo submission
=================

## Description
'Doors? NO!' actively protests against the use of doors in architecture. Don't
use doors. Use hyperbolic geometry to travel around your room, your house or
the entire world! The included game showcases the use of hyperbolic geometry
in architecture of a single room. There are also some friend cubes to accompany
you. But you'll have to leave two of them behind with their friends, buttsons.

## Controls:
- WASD: you know the drill
- Mouse: Look around, look around, look around. All around, all around, all around.
- LMB: grab them by the cube
- RMB: let it go

## Disclaimer

We do not take responsibility for any spaghettification, death due to time
travel, accidental teleportation into the endless void, eyes popping out due to
a wall falling into them. This prototype is a Ludum Dare game, hence it is
naturally filled with glitches (mostly visual). Ignore them and try to be smart
about your surroundings.

And remember, think with hyperbolic quantum entaglement.

## Development
This game was made for Ludum Dare 37 compo in 48 hours.
