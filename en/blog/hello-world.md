# Hello, world!

And welcome to my place!
=======================

Hi there! Welcome to my website. A place of joy, code and computers. Now that
you're here, I'd like to walk you through some things you can do around here,
besides looking at this wonderful CSS design of course.

The first, most obvious, and the thing you're doing right now is reading
my blog. I will be posting many different things. I'll be posting updates
on my games and programs, my thoughts on different things I encounter,
my philosophical thoughts and reflections, possibly some events from my
real life, tutorials, and really whatever comes into my head.

The second thing is to read about my games in the [games](/en/games) category.
I make games from time to time. All notable games I made are listed in there
chronologically.

The third thing is to read about the programs and libraries I made, most notably
the [ylw-lang](/en/ylw). But there are also some [other](/en/other) interesting
things.

The fourth and final thing might not be for everyone, but it sure as hell is
necessary. That's my [Curriculum Vitae](/en/cv). If you have an IT or gamedev
related business, please consider reading it. Just like that. I don't even mind
shameless self-promotion if it gets me anywhere. You shouldn't either. There's
nothing wrong with that.

By the way, you might want to consider reading the [about](/en/about) section.
There's some interesting stuff about me and this website in there.
