# Hello, world!

And welcome to my place!
=======================

I'm glad you somehow managed to find my website. Now I'd like to walk you
through some of the things you will be able to do in here.

The first, most obvious, and the thing you're doing right now is reading
my blog. I will be posting many different things. I'll be posting updates
on my games and programs, my thoughts on different things I encounter,
my philosophical thoughts and reflections, possibly some events from my
real life, tutorials, and really whatever comes into my head.

The second thing is to read about my games in the [games](/en/games)
category. I make games from time to time. All notable games I made are
listed in there chronologically.

The third thing is to read about the programs and libraries I made, most
notably the [ylw-lang](/en/ylw). It's still WIP though, But there
are also some [other](/en/other) interesting things.

The fourth and final thing might not be for everyone, but it sure as hell
is necessary. That's my [Curriculum Vitae](/en/cv). If you have
an IT or gamedev related business, please consider reading it. Just like
that. I don't even mind shameless self-promotion if it gets me anywhere.

By the way, you might want to consider reading the
[about](/en/about) section. There's some interesting stuff
about me and this website in there.
