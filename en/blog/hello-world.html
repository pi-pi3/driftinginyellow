# Hello, world!

        And welcome to my place!

    I'm glad you somehow managed to find my website. Now I'd like to walk you
    through some of the things you will be able to do in here.


    The first, most obvious, and the thing you're doing right now is reading
    my blog. I will be posting many different things. I'll be posting updates
    on my games and programs, my thoughts on different things I encounter,
    my philosophical thoughts and reflections, possibly some events from my
    real life, tutorials, and really whatever comes into my head.


    The second thing is to read about my games in the <a href="/en/games">
    games</a>
    category. I make games from time to time. All notable games I made are
    listed in there chronologically.


    The third thing is to read about the programs and libraries I made, most
    notably the <a href="/en/ylw">ylw-lang</a>. It's still WIP though, But there
    are also some <a href="/en/other">other</a> interesting things.


    The fourth and final thing might not be for everyone, but it sure as hell
    is necessary. That's my <a href="/en/cv">Curriculum Vitae</a>. If you have
    an IT or gamedev related business, please consider reading it. Just like
    that. I don't even mind shameless self-promotion if it gets me anywhere.


    By the way, you might want to consider reading the 
    <a href="/en/about">about</a> section. There's some interesting stuff
    about me and this website in there.
