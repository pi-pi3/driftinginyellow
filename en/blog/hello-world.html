<p>
    I'm glad you somehow managed to find my website. Now I'd like to walk you
    through some of the things you will be able to do in here.
</p>
<p>
    The first, most obvious, and the thing you're doing right now is reading
    my blog. I will be posting many different things. I'll be posting updates
    on my games and programs, my thoughts on different things I encounter,
    my philosophical thoughts and reflections, possibly some events from my
    real life, tutorials, and really whatever comes into my head.
</p>
<p>
    The second thing is to read about my games in the <a href="games">games</a>
    category. I make games from time to time. All notable games I made are
    listed in there chronologically.
</p>
<p>
    The third thing is to read about the programs and libraries I made, most
    notably the <a href="ylw">ylw-lang</a>. It's still WIP though, But there
    are also some <a href="other">other</a> interesting things.
</p>
<p>
    The fourth and final thing might not be for everyone, but it sure as hell
    is necessary. That's my <a href="cv">Curriculum Vitae</a>. If you have
    an IT or gamedev related business, please consider reading it. Just like
    that. I don't even mind shameless self-promotion if it gets me anywhere.
</p>
<p>
    By the way, you might want to consider reading the 
    <a href="about">section</a>. There's some interesting stuff about me and
    this website in there.
