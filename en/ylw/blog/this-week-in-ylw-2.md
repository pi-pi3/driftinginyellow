# This week in ylw 2

Everything has to start somewhere
====

Another week in ylw! Although this one has been a short one, since the last
'This week in ylw' was late by a couple days. This last week hasn't seen a lot
of changes. There haven't been many changes, but they're worth the time. The
new changes are as follows.

## Things I did this week:
### decl, decle, new

The three biggest changes are the three new vm instructions. They are: `decl`,
`decle` and `new`. `decl` and `decle` have both been explained last week in
[This week in ylw 1](/en/ylw/?id=this-week-in-ylw-1). `new` is a new instruction
used for instantiating types. However, it isn't written explicitly in llr. It's
use as following.

`type://Foo 1 2.0 "3" <br>
`type://core/Integer 1` <br>
`type://some/Type arg1 arg2 argn` <br>
`type://some/Enum/Variant arg1 arg2 argn` <br>

## Things I'm working on:
### meta-macro

still *wip*
